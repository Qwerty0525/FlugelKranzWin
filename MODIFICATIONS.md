## 2026-09-14 — SlimeVR and other HMD-anchored solvers

Affected files: `native/driver/Driver.cpp`, `native/driver/Transform.h`,
`native/driver/FrameHistory.h`, `native/driver/TransformTests.cpp`,
`native/driver/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`.

SlimeVR's SteamVR driver reads HMD and controller poses back through
`IVRServerDriverHost::GetRawTrackedDevicePoses` and builds its skeleton around
them. Those poses already carry the flight transform, so the skeleton was
assembled around the flown head and the flight then landed on SlimeVR's
trackers a second time. Measured on Quest 2 + Touch / Virtual Desktop /
SlimeVR with the flight held at 33.6 m of translation, SlimeVR's six trackers
sat 0.4–1.0 m from the flown head and about 33 m from the physical head, while
Virtual Desktop's arm trackers and the controllers were the reverse.

The driver now hooks `GetRawTrackedDevicePoses` and removes the transform last
applied to each device, but only for callers whose module file name appears in
the new `physicalPoseDrivers` setting (default `driver_slimevr.dll`). Such a
solver then sees the physical body, and its trackers take the flight exactly
once like every other device, for both translation and rotation.

A second setting, `hmdAnchoredTrackingSystems`, applies rotation about the
flown HMD to devices whose `Prop_TrackingSystemName_String` matches. It exists
for solvers the readback hook cannot reach and defaults to empty: it stops the
doubled translation but mixes flown head orientation with physical body
orientation, which visibly twisted the legs once rotation was involved.

Both settings live in `driver/flugelkranz/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`
and are documented in `native/driver/README.md`.

### Testing

`transform_tests` covers the pivoted rotation, the physical readback including
velocities, and the identity pass-through. All three native test suites and
186 of 189 C# tests pass; the three failures are pre-existing
`Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` discovery errors introduced upstream by the xunit v4
dependency bump in `6dfcb65`, unrelated to these changes.

Verified on hardware with Quest 2 + Touch, Virtual Desktop over SteamVR, and
SlimeVR full-body tracking. Flight with the Virtual Desktop virtual elbow
trackers unassigned in SlimeVR behaved correctly over several sessions.
Rotation-heavy flight with those virtual trackers reassigned has not been
re-tested since the readback hook replaced the rotation-only approach.

## 2026-10-25 — Keep the raw-pose readback off the pose-update lock

Affected file: `native/driver/Driver.cpp`.

The readback hook above took the same mutex that pose updates hold across
their IPC mutex waits. SlimeVR polls `GetRawTrackedDevicePoses` about every
2 ms, so the HMD's own pose updates queued behind it and the headset view
juddered while moving with FlugelKranz running. Measured from the driver's
FrameAudit log on the same hardware, the render correction used HMD samples
47 ms or older in 72% of flying frames, against 0.3% before the hook existed.

The transforms last applied to each device now have their own mutex, held only
for one assignment by a pose update or one array copy by the readback, and the
readback processes its copy unlocked. Each call site is classified once and
cached in lock-free atomics, so the readback no longer takes the loader lock
either.

### Testing

All three native test suites pass. Not yet confirmed on hardware.
